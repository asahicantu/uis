The camera has 2048 pixels horizontally, and 1536 pixels vertically. The active region on the CCD-chip is $10\\text{mm} \\times 7.5\\text{mm}$. We define the spatial coordinates $(x_w,y_w)$ such that the origin is at the center of the optical axis, x-axis horizontally and y-axis vertically upwards. The image indexes $(x,y)$ is starting in the upper left corner. For simplicity let the optical axis meet the image plane at $(x_{0}=1024,y_{0}=768)$. The solutions to this problem can be found from simple geometric considerations. Make a sketch of the situation and answer the following questions:\n",
