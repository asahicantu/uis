    "\n",
    "An image can be considered as a 2-dimensional (2D) signal. \n",
    "Sampling is in the domain of spatial coordinates $(x_w,y_w)$. \n",
    "The continuous intensity function, $g(x_w,y_w)$, is sampled such that the image representation is a matrix, $g(x,y)$, where the indexes, $x$ and $y$ is connected to the coordinates by $x_w = x \\,\\Delta x_w$ and $y_w = y\\,\\Delta y_w$. \n",
    "The distance between each pixel is $\\Delta x_w$ horizontally and $\\Delta y_w$ vertically. \n",
    "We use $g(x,y)$, with indexes $y \\in \\{1,2, \\cdots Y\\}$ and $x \\in \\{1,2, \\cdots X\\}$. The image is rectangular, represented by a matrix of size  $Y \\times X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent the image in the frequency domain by taking the discrete Fourier transform. \n",
    "In this problem we will use the power spectrum defined by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{Lab2eq1}\n",
    "    P(i,j) = |G(i,j)|^{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $G(i,j)$ is the 2D DFT of the signal (image) $g(i,j)$. \n",
    "Most images has a large mean value (\"DC-component\") that gives a dominating peak in the frequency origin $(0,0)$. \n",
    "A typical image is also dominated by low frequency components and the power of high frequencies is low. \n",
    "The DFT assumes periodic signals, i.e. when an image is repeated periodically in all directions we usually get an edge at the border of the image.\n",
    "This will give a response in the spectrum as a horizontal and vertical line through the origin. \n",
    "To avoid this it is common to use a bell shaped window function that reduces the signal to zero at the borders. \n",
    "This method for spectral estimation is called *windowed periodogram*. The function **impowsp2** that you will find here implements this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to visualize the power spectrum by an image, i.e. we transform the image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. \n",
    "To enhance the high frequency components we use the following point operation\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{Lab2eq2}\n",
    "    B(i,j) = \\log(1+P(i,j))\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the point operation the DC-component must be removed **[*]** and the power spectrum should be centered (using **np.fftshift**), such that the frequency $(0,0)$ is in the center of the power spectrum image. \n",
    "We use **plt.imshow** to display the power spectrum image and choose normalized frequencies **[+]** for the axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**[*]** *This can be done by setting the center pixel in the power spectrum to zero. It can also be accomplished by subtracting the mean from the input image such that we find the DFT from a zero mean signal.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**[+]** *The Fourier Transform of a digital signal is computed by the DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) which is periodic in the frequency domain. One period corresponds to $2\\pi$ ($[-\\pi,\\pi]$) for the angular frequency. We normalize this such that the frequency is in the interval $[-0.5,0.5]$.*"
