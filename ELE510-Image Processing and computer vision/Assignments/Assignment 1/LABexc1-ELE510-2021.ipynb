    "**c)** The image data can be written to new files with a chosen format. Use `cv2.imwrite` and JPG. We want to study different degrees of compression by using `[cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY, jpg_quality]` as option in the `cv2.imwrite` function, where `cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY` is the quality flag, and `jpg_quality` is the selected quality for saving the image. Let `jpg_qualities` be `[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,95]` and make a graph that show the filesize in kB as a function of `jpg_qualities` for this image. When a repeated procedure is done, like in this case, it is efficient to make a script or a function for the problem. Display the compressed images for `jpg_qualities=10` and `jpg_qualities=50` (use `plt.imshow`). Study these images and discuss the degradation of the images caused by the compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** A simple way of finding objects in an image is by using thresholding. The OpenCV function `threshold`. performs simple thresholding and ouputs a logical image matrix. We want to find a logical mask identifying the flower (foreground and not the background) in our image. We can do that by combining the result from thresholding the red component and the blue component, `Fmask = Bmask or Rmask`. `Bmask` is the output from thresholding the blue component with a level of approximately (160/255) and `Rmask` is the result from thresholding the red component with level (200/255) approximately. Execute these operations and adjust the two levels for the best result. Display the final logical image `Fmask` and describe the result.\n",
