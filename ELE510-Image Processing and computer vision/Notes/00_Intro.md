## GOAL
Exploit the power of visual sensing to observe/percieve the environment and give appropriate reactions to it. 
Build artifitial systems that obtain information from images.

# Concepts
## Enhancement
Image processing problem, transform an image to another that improves visual appearance
## Restoration
Restore corrupted images by some type of noise
## Compression
Store images with fewer bits than its original size
## Segmentation
Determining which pixels in an image belong together (projections of the same oject in scene)
## Classification
Determine which pixels of a region in an image belong to a model/class
## Shape from X
Recover three-dimensional structure of the scene
## Machine vision
Control placement of the camera and lighting conditions by industrial settings
## Computer vision
Unstructured settings, orfinary life problems taken by common cameras and sensors

# Image basics
Imaging systems 
Extract and decompose the 3D world into 2D Images by an imaging system
** Pixel ** = Picture element
## Image digitalization
Sampling measuring the value of an image position at a finite number of elements
Quantization representation of the measured value at the sample point 

Matrix of numbers, 8 bit words
Image capture in Three channels RGB [Each of 1 byte size = 24 bytes per RGB pixel]

RGB - Additive color mixing (Describes what kind of light must be emitted to produce a given color)

CMY(K) - Subtractive color mixing. Describes what kind of colored ink has to be applied so the light reflected form the paper produces the given color MIXING OF COLOR

## Image Types
* Grayscale 0-255
* 
* RGB 
	* Interleaved [RGB] [RGB] all colors in sequence
	* Plana one byte per pixelr [R R R] [G G G] [B B B]
	* Alpha value or opaciti 
* Binary
* Logical image
* Real valued image  double precision floating point numer
* Integer-valued image

Image representation - 2D Intensity function
f(x,y)
Grayscale image
Color image
Hyperspectral image

Downsampling
Reducing scale and number of bytes

False contouring

Reducingn the number of gray levels = Contours

## Human vission



Luminous efficienc function (LEF) Captures the relative sensitivity of the visual systems to different wavelenghts

Photopic LEF. Corresponds to normal light levels where the cones dominate due to saturations of the roads



**Scotopic LEF**  Low light levels where the rods dominate due to the lack of sensitivity of the cones



Disparity allows the observation of 3D

Light is an electromagnetic wave
