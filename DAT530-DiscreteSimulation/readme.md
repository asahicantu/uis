## Discrete Simulation And Performance Analysis
Modeling simulation and performance evaluation - Primary tool for developing engineering systems

Simulation is cheaper, faster and safer than conducting experiments with a prototype of final product
Potential to build huge systems, evaluate  and foresee the 'emergence' fenommenon

Most of computer science/ manufacturing projects are discrete event systems
Tools:
- **Petri nets**
- Grafset (Sequential functional Chart)
- StateCharts (SFD)
- Ladder Diagram
- Automaton
- SimEvents (Matlab comercial package)
- Flexim (Simulation animations) [Black box approach]
