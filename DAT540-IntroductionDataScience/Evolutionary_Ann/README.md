# OPENAI Evolutionary_Ann

Final project presentation for OPENAI project.

## Description
This project uses a genetic algorithm programmed by our team to train a cartpole.
Throughout several iterations the car learns to hold a stick in equilibrium

Given below is one solution state I found evolving over 50 generations for 'CartPole-v0' environment. 
Ive never found it to fail even testing it over 10 minutes.
